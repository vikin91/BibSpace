In this position paper, we discuss how the existing concept of virtual appliances can be extended to automate the extraction of architecture-level performance models during system operation.','{Towards Online Performance Model Extraction in Virtualized Environments}',0,9,2013,9,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-01-24 21:18:01',0),(61,'paper','bender2010','mastersthesis','@mastersthesis{bender2010,\n  address = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  author = {Konstantin Bender},\n  month = {May},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  title = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\n  year = {2010},\n}\n\n','Konstantin Bender, .\nAutomated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics.\nMaster\'s thesis, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, Karlsruhe, Germany, May 2010.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"bib-preview-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-bender2010\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;]\n<div id=\"bib-of-bender2010\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><pre>@mastersthesis{bender2010,\n  address = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  author = {Konstantin Bender},\n  month = {May},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  title = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\n  year = {2010},\n}\n\n</pre></div>','<a name=\"bender2010\"></a><pre>\n@mastersthesis{bender2010,\n  address = {Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  author = {Konstantin Bender},\n  month = {May},\n  school = {Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany},\n  title = {{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}},\n  year = {2010}\n}\n</pre>\n\n',NULL,'{Automated Performance Model Extraction of Enterprise Data Fabrics}',0,5,2010,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-01-24 21:18:01',0),(65,'paper','groenda2008c','techreport','@techreport{groenda2008c,\n  abstract = {Systematische Qualit\\\"{a}tssicherung gewinnt im Rahmen des globalenWettbewerbs auch in der Software-Entwicklungsbranche zunehmend an Bedeutung.

Increased flexibility and dynamics, however, also result in a higher system complexity. This complexity carries on to run-time resource management for Quality-of-Service (QoS) enforcement, rendering design-time approaches for QoS assurance inadequate. In this paper, we present a set of novel meta-models that can be used to describe the resource landscape, the architecture and resource layers of dynamic virtualized data center infrastructures, as well as their run-time adaptation and resource management aspects. With these meta-models we introduce new modeling concepts to improve model-based run-time QoS assurance. We evaluate our meta-models by modeling a representative virtualized service infrastructure and using these model instances for run-time resource allocation.

Service composition frameworks offer corresponding functionality and hide the complexity of the underlying technologies from their users. However, possibilities for anticipating quality properties of com- posed services before their actual operation are limited so far. While existing approaches for model-based software quality prediction can be used by service composers for determining realizable Quality of Service (QoS) levels, integration of such techniques into composition frameworks is still missing. As a result, high effort and expert knowledge is required to build the system models required for prediction. In this paper, we present a novel service composition process that includes QoS prediction for composed services as an integral part.

This is due to the inability to predict at run-time the effect of dynamic changes in the system environment (e.g., varying service workloads) and adapt the system configuration accordingly.

However, existing approaches to performance modeling and analysis of publish/subscribe systems suffer from many limitations that seriously constrain their practical applicability. In this paper, we present a generalized method for stochastic analysis of publish/subscribe systems employing identity-based hierarchical routing.

The scenarios for which we demonstrate our formalism include resource provisioning of global providers of infrastructure and/or platform resources, online social networking services, user-data processing services, online customer and ticketing services, online asset management and banking applications, CRM (Customer Relationship Management) applications, and online social gaming applications.}','{Cloud Usage Patterns: A Formalism for Description of Cloud Usage Scenarios}',0,5,2013,5,NULL,NULL,'Cloud','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-01-24 21:18:01',0),(433,'paper','MiKoAvAnVi2013-TechReport-OnBenchmarkingIDSes','techreport','@techreport{MiKoAvAnVi2013-TechReport-OnBenchmarkingIDSes,\n  abstract = {{Modern intrusion detection systems (IDSes) for virtualized environments are deployed in the virtualization layer with components inside the virtual machine monitor (VMM) and the trusted host virtual machine (VM).

In this context, a high degree of automation is desired, which can be achieved by applying autonomic computing concepts. This paper particularly focuses the autonomic management of semi-dynamic compositions. Here, for each included service several variants are available that differ with regard to the service level they offer. Given this scenario, we first show how to instrument WSC in order to allow a controlling of the service level through switching the employed service variant.

distributed systems in many industry domains including telecommunications, transportation, and supply chain management. However, the loose coupling of components in such systems makes it hard for developers to estimate their behaviour and performance under load. Most general purpose performance meta-models for component-based systems provide limited support for modelling event-driven communication. In this paper, we present a case study of a real-life road traffic monitoring system that shows how event-driven communication can be modelled for performance prediction and capacity planning. Our approach is based on the Palladio Component Model (PCM) which we have extended to support event-driven communication. We evaluate the accuracy of our modelling approach in a number of different workload and configuration scenarios.

However, the loose coupling of components in such systems makes it hard for developers to predict their performance under load. Most general purpose performance meta-models for component-based systems provide limited support for modelling event-based communication and neglect middleware-specific influence factors.

The loose coupling of components in such systems makes it easy to vary the deployment. At the same time, the complexity to estimate the behavior and performance of the whole system is increased, which complicates capacity planning. In this paper, we present an automated performance prediction method supporting capacity planning for event-based systems. The performance prediction is based on an extended version of the Palladio Component Model -- a performance meta-model for component-based systems.

In this demonstration, we present jms2009-PS, a benchmark for publish/subscribe middleware based on the Java Message Service standard interface.','{A Performance Test Harness For Publish/Subscribe Middleware}',0,6,2009,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-01-24 21:18:01',0),(571,'paper','SaKoBaBu2008-PERFEVAL-SPECjms2007','article','@article{SaKoBaBu2008-PERFEVAL-SPECjms2007,\n  abstract = {Message-oriented middleware (MOM) is at the core of a vast number of financial services and telco applications, and is gaining increasing traction in other industries, such as manufacturing, transportation, health-care and supply chain management.

Thus, in this article we introduce a method that fosters evolution by an iterative approach and illustrate how each phase of this method can be tool-supported.','Comprehensive tool support for iterative SOA evolution',0,3,2010,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-01-24 21:18:01',0),(589,'paper','Spinner2011a','mastersthesis','@mastersthesis{Spinner2011a,\n  title = {{Evaluating Approaches to Resource Demand Estimation}},\n  year = {2011},\n  month = {7},\n  abstract = {Proactively managing the performance and resource efficiency of running software systems requires techniques to predict system performance and resource consumption. Typically, performance predictions are based on performance models that capture the performance-relevant aspects of the considered software system.

A number of approaches to estimating the resource demands of a system already exist, e.g., based on regression analysis or stochastic filtering.

Of course, since MKP is NP-hard, the process of solution space construction takes an exponential time, This time, however, is amortized by multiple usages of single solution space for determination of optimal execution plans for multiple complex service requests.','{Graph-fold: an Efficient Method for Complex Service Execution Plan Optimization}',0,0,2010,0,NULL,NULL,'SOA; Optimization','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2017-01-24 21:18:01',0),(678,'paper','RyGo2011-ICSEng','inproceedings','@inproceedings{RyGo2011-ICSEng,\n  address = {Los Alamitos, California USA},\n  author = {Piotr Rygielski and Adam Gonczarek},\n  booktitle = {ICSEng 2011: Proceedings of the 21st international conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng 2011)},\n  day = {16--18},\n  editor = {Henry Selvaraj and Dawid Zydek},\n  location = {Las Vegas, Nevada, USA},\n  month = {August},\n  pages = {212--216},\n  pdf = {http://se2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/pa/publications/download/paper/678.pdf},\n  publisher = {IEEE Computer Society\'s Conference Publishing Services},\n  title = {{Migration-aware Optimization of Virtualized Computational Resources Allocation in Complex Systems}},\n  year = {2011},\n  abstract = {In this paper a task of resources allocation in the complex system is considered.

It is assumed that in certain areas covered by multiple overlapping wireless networks there are a certain number of mobile clients that consume networks resources by use of the available communication services (e.g., voice or data transmission) delivered by network providers.

The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control.

An exact dot product is one of the features of the upcoming interval standard (IEEE Interval Standard Working Group, P1788. http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1788/). Usually an accumulator is realized as a memory block with operations to add floating point numbers and products. Several variants have been proposed to avoid carry rippling: use separate accumulators for positive and negative numbers, initialize the accu with a pattern not equal to zero, or perform a kind of carry look-ahead-technique. All these approaches are described in detail in Kulisch (Computer arithmetic and validityÂ—theory, implementation, and applications. Series: de Gruyter Studies in Mathematics 33, 2008) and Bohlender (Computer arithmetic and self-validating numerical methods, Academic Press, San Diego, 1990). In this paper we propose a long accumulator similar to a carry-save adder. The main idea is to augment the long accumulator with cache information. The cache is used to store the carries or borrows, instead of propagating them through the whole accumulator every time. Due to the cache, operations are kept local in our approach.

expected to deliver reliable performance under highly variable load intensities while at the same time making efficient use of dynamically allocated resources. Conventional benchmarking frameworks provide limited support for emulating such highly variable and dynamic load profiles and workload scenarios. Industrial benchmarks typically use workloads with constant or stepwise increasing load intensity, or they simply replay recorded workload traces. Based on this observation, I identify the need for means allowing flexible definition of load profiles and address this by introducing two meta-models at different abstraction levels. At the lower abstraction level, the Descartes Load Intensity Meta-Model (DLIM) offers a structured and accessible way of describing the load intensity over time by editing and combining mathematical functions. The high-level Descartes Load Intensity Meta-Model (hl-DLIM) allows the description of load variations using few defined parameters that characterize the seasonal patterns, trends, bursts, and noise parts. Using these parameters, hl-DLIM is capable of describing a subset of most common load intensity variations. During the work on this thesis I developed LIMBO - an Eclipse-based tool for modeling variable load intensity profiles based on DLIM and hl-DLIM as underlying modeling formalisms. LIMBO provides visualization for DLIM instances and a model creation wizard based on hl-DLIM parameters. It also offers three automated model extraction processes with which to extract DLIM and hl-DLIM instances from existing arrival rate traces. It also offers a model-to-model transformation from hl-DLIM to DLIM. I demonstrate that both meta-models are capable of capturing real-world load profiles with acceptable accuracy, having an average median deviation of 19.9\\% from the original trace.

When designing an SDN-based WAN architecture, it is of vital importance to find a feasible solution to the controller placement problem, i.e., to decide where to position a limited amount of resources within the network. In addition to time-independent constraints regarding aspects like scalability, resilience, and control plane communication delays, dynamically changing network conditions like traffic patterns or bandwidth demands need to be considered as well. Consequently, such dynamic environments call for a regular and fast recalculation of placements in order to adapt to the current situation in a timely manner.

The need for such an integration is driven by the requirement to continuously adapt enterprise applications (EAs) to changes in the business environment. As of today, DevOps concepts have been primarily introduced to ensure a constant flow of features and bug fixes into new releases from a functional perspective. In order to integrate a non-functional perspective into these DevOps concepts this report focuses on tools, activities, and processes to ensure one of the most important quality attributes of a software system, namely performance. Performance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of resources. Common metrics are response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In order to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are required during development and operation of these systems as well as during the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas activities during operations are called Application Performance Management (APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration between both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to support this integration as well as open research challenges in this area. The report starts by defining EAs and summarizes their characteristics that make performance evaluations for these systems particularly challenging. It continues by describing our understanding of DevOps and explaining the roots of this trend to set the context for the remaining parts of the report. Afterwards, performance management activities that are common in both life cycle phases are explained, until the particularities of SPE and APM are discussed in separate sections. Finally, the report concludes by outlining activities and challenges to support the rapid iteration between Dev and Ops.},\n}\n\n','Andreas Brunnert, , Andre van Hoorn, , Felix Willnecker, , Alexandru Danciu, , Wilhelm Hasselbring, , Christoph Heger, , Nikolas Herbst, , Pooyan Jamshidi, , Reiner Jung, , Joakim von Kistowski, , Anne Koziolek, , Johannes Kro&#223;, , Simon Spinner, , Christian V&#246;gele, , J&#252;rgen Walter, , and Alexander Wert, .\nPerformance-oriented DevOps: A research agenda.\nTechnical Report SPEC-RG-2015-01, SPEC Research Group &mdash; DevOps Performance Working Group, Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC), August 2015.\n[&nbsp;<a class=\"bib-preview-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'bib-of-SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda\')\">bib</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a class=\"abstract-preview-a\" onclick=\"showAbstract(\'abstract-of-SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda\')\">Abstract</a>\n&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://research.spec.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/wg_devops/endorsed_publications/SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http</a>\n&nbsp;]\n<div id=\"bib-of-SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><pre>@techreport{SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda,\n  title = {Performance-oriented {DevOps}: {A} Research Agenda},\n  author = {Andreas Brunnert and Andre van Hoorn and Felix Willnecker and Alexandru Danciu and Wilhelm Hasselbring and Christoph Heger and Nikolas Herbst and Pooyan Jamshidi and Reiner Jung and Joakim von Kistowski and Anne Koziolek and Johannes Kro{\\ss} and Simon Spinner and Christian V{\\\"o}gele and J{\\\"u}rgen Walter and Alexander Wert},\n  institution = {SPEC Research Group --- DevOps Performance Working Group, Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC)},\n  year = {2015},\n  month = {August},\n  number = {SPEC-RG-2015-01},\n  url = {https://research.spec.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/wg_devops/endorsed_publications/SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda.pdf},\n  abstract = {DevOps is a trend towards a tighter integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.

Performance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of resources. Common metrics are response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In order to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are required during development and operation of these systems as well as during the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas activities during operations are called Application Performance Management (APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration between both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to support this integration as well as open research challenges in this area. The report starts by defining EAs and summarizes their characteristics that make performance evaluations for these systems particularly challenging. It continues by describing our understanding of DevOps and explaining the roots of this trend to set the context for the remaining parts of the report. Afterwards, performance management activities that are common in both life cycle phases are explained, until the particularities of SPE and APM are discussed in separate sections. Finally, the report concludes by outlining activities and challenges to support the rapid iteration between Dev and Ops.},\n}\n\n</pre></div>\n<div id=\"abstract-of-SPEC-RG-2015-001-DevOpsPerformanceResearchAgenda\" class=\"inline-bib\" style=\"display:none;\"><blockquote>DevOps is a trend towards a tighter integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.

Existing simulators are unable to analyze the behavior of large systems in a reasonable time, whereas analytical methods suffer from the state space explosion problem. Fluid analysis techniques can be used to approximate the solution of high-order Markov chain models enabling time efficient analysis of large performance models. In this paper, we describe a model-to-model transformation from queueing Petri nets (QPN) into layered queueing networks (LQN). Obtained LQN models can benefit from three existing solvers: LINE, LQNS, LQSIM. LINE internally utilize fluid limits approximation to speed up the solving process for large models.

The strict separation of ``what\'\' versus ``how\'\' enables the development of different techniques and algorithms to automatically select and apply a suitable approach for a given scenario. The goal is to hide complexity from the user by allowing users to express their concerns and goals without requiring any knowledge about performance engineering techniques. Towards realizing the DPE vision, we discuss the different requirements and propose a reference architecture for implementing and integrating respective methods, algorithms, and tooling.</blockquote></div>','<a name=\"WaHoKoOkKo2016-ICPE-DPE_Poster\"></a><pre>\n@misc{WaHoKoOkKo2016-ICPE-DPE_Poster,\n  author = {J\\\"{u}rgen Walter and Andre van Hoorn and Heiko Koziolek and Dusan Okanovic and Samuel Kounev},\n  title = {{The Vision of Declarative Performance Engineering}},\n  booktitle = {{Proceedings of the 7th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2016)}},\n  year = {2016},\n  location = {Delft, the Netherlands},\n  month = {March},\n  day = {12},\n  abstract = {Over the past decades, various methods, techniques, and tools for modeling and evaluating performance properties of software systems have been proposed covering the entire software life cycle.
