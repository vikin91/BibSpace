In this context, elasticity is commonly understood as the ability of a system to automatically provision and de-provision computing resources on demand as workloads change. However, elasticity still lacks a precise definition as well as representative metrics coupled with a benchmarking methodology to enable comparability of systems. Existing definitions of elasticity are largely inconsistent and unspecific leading to confusion in the use of the term and its differentiation from related terms such as scalability and efficiency; the proposed measurement methodologies do not provide means to quantify elasticity without mixing it with efficiency or scalability aspects. In this short paper, we propose a precise definition of elasticity and analyze its core properties and requirements explicitly distinguishing from related terms such as scalability, efficiency, and agility. Furthermore, we present a set of appropriate elasticity metrics and sketch a new elasticity tailored benchmarking methodology addressing the special requirements on workload design and calibration.}},\n  author = {Nikolas Roman Herbst and Samuel Kounev and Ralf Reussner},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC 2013)},\n  day = {24--28},\n  location = {San Jose, CA},\n  month = {June},\n  note = {Acceptance Rate (Short Paper): 36.9\\%},\n  publisher = {USENIX},\n  title = {{Elasticity in Cloud Computing: What it is, and What it is Not}},\n  titleaddon = {{(Short Paper)}},\n  url = {https://www.usenix.org/conference/icac13/elasticity-cloud-computing-what-it-and-what-it-not},\n  year = {2013},\n  pdf = {http://localhost:8083/publications/download/paper/209.pdf},\n  slides = {http://localhost:8083/publications/download/slides/209},\n}\n\n",

Enabling a debate about cloud usage scenarios can help with attracting new customers, sharing best-practices, and designing new cloud services. In contrast to previous approaches, which have attempted mainly to formalize the common service delivery models (i.e., Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-Service), in this work, we propose a formalism for describing common cloud usage scenarios referred to as cloud usage patterns. Our formalism takes a structuralist approach allowing decomposition of a cloud usage scenario into elements corresponding to the common cloud service delivery models.

An exact algorithm is proposed in this paper solving two tasks based on popular quality of service delivery approaches: best-effort and differentiated services. The procedure of graph reduction has been introduced to generate space of possible solutions in such way that decision is made in more efficient way. The graph-fold algorithm was tested in simulation environment where its performance was compared to five reference algorithms. Moreover ability to deliver quality at desired level has been tested.",

Packet scheduling in the network node is one of the crucial mechanisms essential for delivery of required level of quality of services (QoS). In order to satisfy QoS guaranties for each connection belonging to one of distinguished traffic classes, packet scheduling algorithm must make decisions basing on current state of the scheduling system (e.g. buffer lengths) and actual characteristics of the serviced traffic (e.g.: connections lengths, packet intensities within connections, etc.). Here we propose a new packet scheduling algorithm based on Weighted Round Robin (WRR), which weights are adapted according to changes of system and traffic characteristics. By means of computer simulation, on representative examples, we show, that utilization of additional knowledge in the process of packet scheduling may improve QoS guaranties for serviced traffic.",

Different locations (installation place) of available atomic services means that the cost of atomic services delivery (communication and calculation) depends on parts of the distributed systems where the services are performed. The proposed model of SLA translation into complex services structures and variants may be applied among others to calculate upper and lower complex services delivery times and to estimate the validity of possible parallelism in complex services.</blockquote></div>",

In general this task consists of choosing proper versions of atomic services, delivering requested functionalities, such that non-functional requirements for complex service are satisfied.

However, sharing potentially leads to undesired influence from one tenant onto the performance observed by the others. Furthermore, providing one tenant additional resources to support its increasing demands without increasing the performance of tenants who do not pay for it is a major challenge. The application intentionally does not manage hardware resources, and the OS is not aware of application level entities like tenants. Thus, it is difficult to control the performance of different tenants to keep them isolated. These problems gain importance as performance is one of the major obstacles for cloud customers.

To evaluate the quality of elasticity mechanisms provided by different platforms and configurations, respective metrics and benchmarks are required. Existing metrics for elasticity only consider the time required to provision and deprovision resources or the costs impact of adaptations. Existing benchmarks lack the capability to handle open workloads with realistic load intensity profiles and do not explicitly distinguish between the performance exhibited by the provisioned underlying resources, on the one hand, and the quality of the elasticity mechanisms themselves, on the other hand. In this paper, we propose reliable metrics for quantifying the timing aspects and accuracy of elasticity. Based on these metrics, we propose a novel approach for benchmarking the elasticity of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platforms independent of the performance exhibited by the provisioned underlying resources. We show that the proposed metrics provide consistent ranking of elastic platforms on an ordinal scale. Finally, we present an extensive case study of real-world complexity demonstrating that the proposed approach is applicable in realistic scenarios and can cope with different levels of resource efficiency.\n</blockquote></div>\n",

Consequently, such dynamic environments call for a regular and fast recalculation of placements in order to adapt to the current situation in a timely manner. While an exhaustive evaluation of all possible solutions can be performed within a practically feasible time frame for small and medium-sized networks, such an approach is out of scope for large problem instances which have significantly higher time and memory requirements. Therefore, this work investigates a specialized heuristic, which takes into account a particular set of optimization objectives and returns solutions representing the possible trade-offs between them. Due to its low computation time and acceptable margin of error, this heuristic can be employed by automatic decision systems operating in dynamic environments.}",

The report starts by defining EAs and summarizes their characteristics that make performance evaluations for these systems particularly challenging.

We demonstrate the transformations using representative examples. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance predictions of existing analytical, simulation and fluid analysis solvers. We analyze solvers' limitations, solving time, and memory consumption.</blockquote></div>",

This approach has drawbacks such as a higher costs (e.g., bad energy efficiency, if the system is not fully utilized), or bad performance regarding unexpected work peaks. Amazon with its EC2, for instance, provides a configurable scheduled-based and rule-based auto-scaler. However, this reactive scaling has a latency depending on resource type in the order of minutes. Therefore, proactive and application aware auto-scalers are required - intelligent controllers, which can reconfigure the system on time, to ensure high availability and constant performance under changing conditions. The existing auto-scalers can be classified into five groups and prominent examples of each class were investigated. The result of this observation is that the existing controllers are either application-specific or generic. I.e. the auto-scalers can either perform well only on the chosen system or they perform far beyond their means. In this thesis, a novel proactive, application-aware elasticity mechanism called Chameleon is introduced. The proposed controller employs established forecast methods for short-, mid- and long-term predictions of the arriving load intensity, application knowledge, and resource demand estimation to calculate the required resources per work unit. While taking these information into account, the mechanism reconfigures the deployment of an application in a way that the supply of resources matches the current and estimated future demand for resources. I.e., Chameleon consists of two mechanisms: (I) a reactive rule-based controller as fall-back insurance and (II) a proactive controller which has three major building blocks: (a) continuous workload forecasting (using a modified version of WCF) with dynamic forecast method selection, (b) a descriptive performance model/ application knowledge (DML Model@RunTime), and (c) optimized resource demand estimation approaches (using the tool LibReDE). In the evaluation, Chameleon is compared against four different state-of-the-art controllers in a private CloudStack-based environment. The BUNGEE elasticity benchmark framework and metrics are used to conduct and analyse the row of experiments. As workload scenarios, a CPU intensive http application that solves nxn matrices (whereas n is the request parameter) and SPECjEnterprise2010 is used. The applications are driven with variable load profiles (extracted with LIMBO from the FIFA World Cup 1998 trace) generated with JMeter (instead of Faban - as classically used by SPECjEnterprise2010). During the CPU intensive scenario Chameleon achieves the best scaling behaviour (based on user and elasticity metrics) and in the SPECjEnterprise2010 the second best user metrics.",

While model-based approaches are already supported by DQL, measurement based approaches are not. In this paper we present the Kieker4DQL, an adapter for DQL that performs query processing for Application Monitoring Tools, the Kieker in particular. It creates a tailored monitoring configuration to start measurements. The resulting monitoring data is filtered and interpreted according to the query.",
